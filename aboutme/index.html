    <h2>Tracey Johnson</h2>

    <p>I have a Master's Degree in Management Information Systems from Utah State University. I have taught various computer courses from Word Processing to Spreadsheets to Web Design. I am currently the Webmaster for Statewide Campuses at Utah State University.</p>
    <p>I am married with 2 beautiful children (4 if you count their spouses) and one granddaughter.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life and don't know where I would be without it. My favorite scipture is Mark 9:24 "And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief." This just always helps me remember that the Lord will help make up for any lack of belief I may have and help me to grow my faith.</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for allowing me to spend this semester with you!</p>
