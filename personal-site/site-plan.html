        Mission: Utah State University is a premier land- and space-grant institution committed to excellence, access, and inclusion.<br />
        Vision: We empower all people to lead successful lives of involvement, innovation, and impact.<br />
        Stategic Direction: We champion exceptional education, research and discovery, and community contribution.<br />
      <p>(President's Message) I am pleased to release USU's new Strategic Plan to Aggie Action 2028. There is no better time for Utah State University to start a new strategic effort. We have seen a great deal of change over the last few years in all parts of national, state, and local communities and our economy. This includes what students expect from their post-secondary education. The strategic plan does three important things: It identifies who we are, it defines where we want to go, and it measures how well we succeed. Aggie Action 2028 will help ensure we meet the expectations of future students and fulfill our service and outreach mission as a land-grant, R1 institution. This plan will guide us in how we strategically invest university resources in programs and initiatives, positioning USU to take on challenges affecting the state like never before, including in the areas of land, water, air, mental health, and quality of life (to name just a few). Being an Aggie means thinking about how we can best serve our communities, caring about the impact we make in the world, and acting with courage. I encourage the entire university community and stakeholders to read, understand, and embrace this plan. Your support and engagement are essential to our success. Aggie Action 2028 comprises four pillars that highlight USU's areas of focus over the next half decade. Each pillar includes priority objectives and specific outcomes to be achieved.</p>

      <h3>Land-Grant University</h3>
      <p>
        Utah State University is a land-grant institution. President Lincoln’s Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act focused on the practical application of knowledge for people of all classes and walks of life. The second Morrill Act expanded “land-grant” to all Americans, regardless of race, class, or income. Since its founding, Utah State has successfully met these responsibilities for more than 134 years. We continue to strengthen this work with a presence in every county in Utah through today. Every year, millions of Utahns are connected to Utah State and the land-grant mission through 4-H and youth programs; Extension services; family and economic development work; cultural and music programs; athletics; teaching and lifetime learning; research and business development; health, wellness, and nutrition; or other programs
      </p>
      <p><strong>Access:</strong> A college degree opens doors, transforms lives, and can bring up to an additional $1.2 million in earnings over a person’s lifetime. With academic programs available anywhere in Utah or online, USU excels in providing access to post-secondary education for all Utahns. As Utah becomes more diverse, USU is prepared to meet the needs of all learners and help them create an educational legacy for their families.<br >
        <strong>Research:</strong> USU is one of only 146 national universities that have achieved the highest Carnegie research designation of R1 for very high levels of research. USU's land-grant mission ties this research back to Utah communities, and USU has been recognized for having one of the best undergraduate research programs in the nation. USU's Space Dynamics Lab is a trusted agent to the government, supporting national security and defense. As a designated University Affiliated Research Center to the Department of Defense, SDL recently received a $1B contract for over the next 10 years.<br />
        <strong>Outreach:</strong> USU experts are in every county in the state, working on issues affecting all aspects of our lives: business and community development, health and wellness, family finances and relationships, and agriculture and natural resources. The integration of teaching, research, and public service enables USU Extension to respond to serious and emerging issues with research-based, practical information.

      <h3>Plan Process</h3>
      <p>
      <strong>Objective:</strong> USU’s Strategic Plan will provide action goals, objectives, strategies, and measurable outcomes to ensure USU executes and stays true to its mission and achieves its vision of being the nation’s leading land and space grant higher education institution.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Planning Process:</strong> Under the leadership of President Cockett, the planning committee meets bi-monthly with the charge of organizing a strategic plan for presentation to the USU Board of Trustees by December 2022. The committee is committed to receiving “stakeholder input” during the process. A comprehensive review of the mission and vision statement will also be an essential part of the strategic planning process.Strategic action goals will be identified and will serve as the “strategic pillars” of the plan. These action goals are designed to be high-level and are built with the understanding that the University will base priorities on these overarching goals. Objectives will be developed to define the key components of each goal (4 to 5 per goal). Many of the strategies that address the objectives and help achieve the overarching goals will be college- or unit-based. Other strategies will be University-wide. Defined outcomes for each strategic action goal will be aspirational and measurable. The planning process was designed to be a “inclusive” process that ensures stakeholder buy-in. USU’s president Noelle Cockett, is very involved in the process to ensure the goals, objectives and strategies align with USU’s mission and vision, as well as the Utah State Board of Higher Education’s goals of access, affordability, completion, research, and system unification</p>
