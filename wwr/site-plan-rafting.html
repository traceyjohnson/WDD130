    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This site's intended audience is adventurers either visiting or living near the Dry Oar River area who are looking for something exciting to do. They are anticipated to have disposable income, and a love of the great outdoors and a need for adventure. Visitors to the site, and those who will most be able to decide to book a trip, will likely be between the ages of 16-55. They will mostly be living in Dry Oar River City, with some scattering of beach house communities on the shoreline of Dry Oar River, among whom we have a loyal customer base. Most potential customers will be accessing the site on their phones, not personal computers, however there will be a need for the website to be desktop and tablet compatible.</p>
